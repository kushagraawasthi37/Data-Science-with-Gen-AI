## 📌 Why This Repository Exists

Most resources:

- ❌ are too theoretical
- ❌ skip _why_ things work
- ❌ are scattered across blogs & videos

This repo is different.

✔ Built **from scratch → advanced**  
✔ Written with **interview mindset**  
✔ Explained in **simple language (Hinglish + English)**  
✔ Includes **code + theory + intuition + pitfalls**  
✔ Perfect for **students, freshers & 1–3 YOE professionals**
